<p>During this period America mobilized her young men in unprecedented numbers. The commissioning crew of Astoria came from all corners of the United States. Some men came from the existing Navy, including six sailors who had served aboard &ldquo;Nasty Asty,&ldquo;Astoria CA-34. Many others were &ldquo;learning the ropes&rdquo; at naval training stations and schools across the nation.</p>

<p>From the Mighty Ninety cruise book:
It all started back in Philadelphia on the 15th of May 1944 when the majority of the crew reported aboard two days before commissioning. We were all pretty green then, didnâ€™t know much about the Navy or the sea, but we had a job to do and we were determined to do it well. We spent the first two days finding our way around the ship and on the 17th of May 1944 we were commissioned.</p>
<p>The Astoria commissioning ceremony took place at Philadelphia Navy Yard. 4th Naval District Commandant Rear Admiral Milo F. Draemel presided. The first watch was set and Astoria became a United States Ship, under command of Captain George C. Dyer and executive officer Commander Erasmus W. Armentrout, Jr.</p>

<p>The men who reported aboard USS Astoria on or before 17 May 1944 were considered &ldquo;Plankowners,&rdquo; a long-standing U.S. Navy tradition recognizing the commissioning crew of a ship. Following the commissioning ceremony, these men were issued Plankowner&rsquo;s Certificates.</p>

<p>While the Mighty Ninety went through the final preparations for her shakedown, the eyes of the world focused on the French coastal region of Normandy. Overnight, the Allied Expeditionary Force comprised of Canadian, British, and American forces had launched a combined airborne and seaborne invasion of German-occupied France. The invasion would come to be known worldwide as D-Day.</p>
