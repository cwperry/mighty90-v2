<p>With American involvement in the Second World War becoming more and more imminent, the U.S. Navy placed an order for six additional Cleveland-class cruisers to be added to their Fiscal Year 1941 building program. Construction of these six cruisers, Navy hull numbers CL-89 through CL-94, was awarded to the revitalized Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>The six Cramp Clevelands kept with the tradition of naming cruisers after U.S. cities and were to be named:</p>

<p>The keel of hull 533 was laid by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia, PA. In the months that followed, this hull began to take on the sleek lines of a cruiser.</p>
<h3 id="7-december-1941">7 December 1941</h3>
<p>Hull 533 was three months into its construction when the nation learned that U.S. military installations had been attacked by Imperial Japan on the island of Oahu, Territory of Hawaii, most notably at Pearl Harbor. In the days that followed, Japanese attacks were expanded to American, British, Dutch, and Australian interests across the Pacific. America became a nation at war.</p>

<p>Eight months after declaring war, the United States launched its first offensive against Japan. First light brought the kickoff of a pivotal invasion of the strategic Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal, Florida, and Tulagi. Three U.S. heavy cruisers took the lead in preparatory shore bombardment. USS Vincennes CA-44, USS Quincy CA-39, and USS Astoria CA-34.</p>

<p>In night action off Guadalcanal near Savo Island, the U.S. Cruisers Vincennes, Quincy, and Astoria were all sunk by a Japanese force along with the Australian cruiser HMAS Canberra. Astoria CA-34, &ldquo;Nasty Asty&rdquo; to her crew, was hit at least 65 times by enemy shells. Her surviving crew worked through the night and morning to save their ship, but shortly after noon the next day, she gave in to overwhelming fires and slipped beneath the surface. Astoria was the last ship in the battle to sink.</p>

<p>For over two months the American public was not informed of the losses at Savo. Meanwhile work continued on the two Cleveland-class cruisers at Cramp, Miami CL-89 and Wilkes-Barre CL-90. Although Cramp was also busy building submarines and auxiliaries, the shipyard&rsquo;s capacity for cruisers was only two at a time; the keel-laying on Oklahoma City CL-91 had to wait until CL-89 was launched.</p>

<p>USS Astoria had been a proud ship, serving with distinction throughout her career. In the early days of World War II, she performed screen duty for American carriers during the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, and she went down fighting at Guadalcanal. It was only fitting that the Navy would christen a new USS Astoria along with other cruisers lost early in the war.</p>
<p>In late October 1942, the hull of CL-90 was renamed from Wilkes-Barre to Astoria to commemorate the sacrifices of Nasty Asty and her crew. Other &ldquo;vengeance ships&rdquo; began to slide down the ways in an American Navy that would come to dwarf its pre-war predecessor in scale.</p>

<p>After 18 months of construction, the completed hull of Astoria was launched into the Delaware River. She was sponsored by Mrs. Peggy Lucas, wife of the editor of the Astorian-Budget newspaper and a direct descendant of John Jacob Astor.</p>

<p>Once in the water, construction shifted to finishing out Astoria&rsquo;s superstructure. She was still fourteen months from completion and commissioning. Other ships were being built in unprecedented numbers, including more Cleveland-class cruisers.</p>
<p>Across the river from Astoria at New York Ship, CL-103 was launched several months later with the reassigned name of Wilkes-Barre. Up at the Bethlehem Fore River Yard in Quincy, MA, Pasadena CL-65 and Springfield CL-66 were also nearing completion. These four Cleveland-class cruisers would ultimately serve together as Cruiser Division 17 throughout 1945.</p>
