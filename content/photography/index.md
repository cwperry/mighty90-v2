*A hidden world awaits*... The camera equipment of the WWII era was capable of capturing amazing detail. Using light meters, large negative sizes, and good optics, the photographers of this period brought art to their craft.

Much of this art has been lost over the decades. Most photographs remain tucked away in private collections or public archives, rarely seeing the light of day. They fade, crack and deteriorate even as they lay dormant in storage.

Of the images that are published, most are reproduced in books and online as grainy copies of copies. Detail is lost, taking with it the grounding in reality that makes these images poignant reminders of a period when the world caught fire.

The mission of this website is to inform, but also to restore and preserve these images while making them accessible to a worldwide audience for the first time. This page illustrates the painstaking process involved in the restoration effort of applying technology to history.

Many have never been publicly seen or reproduced.
