Herman Schnipper was an avid photographer before he joined the U.S. Navy.  After boot camp, he was assigned to the ship's complement for the new light cruiser USS *Astoria* mustering in Newport, Rhode Island.  Because of his familiarity and experience with photographic equipment, Schnipper was assigned as ship's photographer.  He became a Mighty Ninety plankowner when he reported aboard ship at her commissioning on 17 May 1944 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

Schnipper began his chronicle of USS *Astoria*'s WWII experience using his personal 35mm camera.  He received his Navy-issue camera equipment during the ship's shakedown cruise.  For the remainder of 1944 and throughout 1945, he photographed events experienced by the ship and her crew ranging from the Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa to the Japanese Home Islands.  During periods of General Quarters, Schnipper had a unique battle station--anywhere on the ship to record events as they happened.

The images taken by Schnipper and other Navy photographers throughout the fleet were sent back stateside as the war progressed.  In addition to providing news updates from the front lines of the Pacific, many photographs were provided to newspapers for feature stories about local servicemen.  Schnipper himself was in one such feature story, as he was one of seven *Astoria* sailors from the hometown of Bayonne, New Jersey.

When the war ended and USS *Astoria* returned home, Schnipper remained aboard for six more months.  During this time he maintained his photographic responsibilities as Mighty Ninety brought servicemen home from Pearl Harbor and conducted training along the West Coast.  In April 1946, with enough points to go home, Schnipper returned to New Jersey for the first time in two years.

Schnipper remained in the U.S. Navy Reserves.  In 1947, he went to sea one final time aboard the battleship USS *Wisconsin* BB-64.  He resumed his responsibilities as ship's photographer for the duration of a midshipman's cruise in the Atlantic.

In 1973, shipmates from the Mighty Ninety held their first reunion in Boston.  Herman was in attendance and took photographs of the event.  In the years that followed, he attended every USS *Astoria* CL-90 reunion save one--and he always filled the role of photographer.

Herman Schnipper's wartime photographs were reproduced in newspapers across the country during the war.  Many of his images are in the collection of the U.S. National Archives as well as maritime museums in Madison, WI and Astoria, OR.  His work has been reproduced in WWII history books and other publications, and appears in online naval photo archives including www.navsource.org and this website.

Schnipper remains active in the U.S. Navy Cruiser Sailors Association.
