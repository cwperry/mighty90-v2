Combat Photography Unit 6 (CPU-6) was comprised of a number of U.S. Navy Fleet Photographers who dispersed across multiple warships to photograph the final campaigns of the Pacific War. During Okinawa operations they shot still and moving images from the ships of Task Group 58.1.Following the conclusion of Okinawa operations, CPU-6 redeployed aboard ships of Task Group 38.3, including USS *Astoria* CL-90.

Photographer's Mates Rudolph Guttosch and Thomas Higgins were assigned to USS *Astoria* CL-90 for the Japanese Home Island raids of July-August 1945. Guttosch was responsible for still imagery and Higgins was to shoot film footage. While aboard ship they got to know and work with established ship's photographer Herman Schnipper.
