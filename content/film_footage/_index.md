Between 18 March and 14 April 1945, three reels of color film were shot aboard USS *Astoria* CL-90 by a U.S. Navy fleet photographer named Walter J. Duggan. This film depicts the height of combat for *Astoria* during Okinawa operations.

Reels 1 and 3 were located in the collection of the National Archives. They have been digitally transferred and restored to their original color by ColorLab for this project.

Reel 2, thought to be lost, was located in a VHS copy in the hands of Gary DiMaio, son of *Astoria* plankowner Mario DiMaio. This VHS copy has been digitally transferred with as much retention of color and quality as possible.

All 42 minutes of silent footage are presented in chronological order, divided into segments. Each segment has been cross-referenced with deck logs, action reports, and the photographs of *Astoria* ship's photographer Herman Schnipper to ensure complete accuracy.


## Reel 1: 18-20 March 1945
This reel of silent color film footage is preserved in the collection of the National Archives, record number 428-NPC-11476.

Although most of the visible damage is in the aft of the ship, the photographer primarily focuses on the bow section.  This suggests that funerals taking place on the hangar deck might have been the intended subject matter."
