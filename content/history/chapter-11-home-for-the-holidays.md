### 24 December 1944

The Fast Carrier Task Force returned to Anchorage at Ulithi.  Many ships had some degree of damage from the typhoon, including some with serious structural damage such as USS MIAMI.

USS *Astoria* had weathered the storm comparatively well, but she still suffered its effects.  Both of her Kingfisher floatplanes were damaged beyond repair. The ship officially reported one significant injury, although there were others.

### 26 December 1944

Unknown to most men of the fleet, an official Court of Inquiry was convened the day after Christmas in the wardroom aboard the destroyer tender USS CASCADE AD-16.  Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief U.S. Pacific Fleet, had personally flown to Ulithi to find out what had happened in the typhoon.

The losses in war matériel were staggering:  Three destroyers sunk, three light carriers headed out of theater for repairs, many other ships damaged, 146 aircraft destroyed.  The losses in personnel were even more devastating: 790 U.S. service personnel were lost at sea, and 80 more were seriously injured.

The Court of Inquiry recorded testimony for the days that followed, and did not reach its conclusions until after Third Fleet had returned to sea for the next stage of Philippine operations.  Its findings were that the preponderance of responsibility lay with Admiral Halsey, and that greater care should have been taken in light of available information and deteriorating conditions.  Halsey's saving grace had been his commitment to stay on station in support of Mindoro operations.

### 28 December 1944

Following a short holiday rest, the task force began preparations to return to sea. Repairs were made and ships were shifted between task groups to adjust for losses and new arrivals. Third Fleet may have spend Christmas Day at anchor, but they would be underway for the next phase of Philippine operations for New Year's Day 1945.
