Tucked into the back pages of the May 7th 1945 issue, LIFE magazine ran a four-page article about the tiny Pacific island of Fassarai. Mostly comprised of photos of island life, the article only contained a few paragraphs of text which read:

### LIFE Visits an Enchanted Isle

> Americans take Fassarai and find it the romantic kind of South Sea Island they have always dreamed about.

> American fighting men who have traveled to the South Pacific in this war have looked in vain for the legendary South Sea islands. Writers like Robert Louis Stevenson and movies like "White Shadows in the South Seas" had prepared them for a happy land of waving palms, warm sand and half-nude girls, a place where life was no work at all. Last fall, when the U.S. took the atoll of Ulithi, 400 miles southwest of Guam, Americans found the closest approach to such a place. On the island of Fassarai in the atoll the palms waved, the sand was warm, and the girls were beautiful. Fassarai was shortly declared off-limits.

           attr="Carl Mydans photo in LIFE/Getty Images collection"
>}}

The LIFE text continued:
> Although the people of Fassarai are bronzed and unspoiled, they have been saddened by their recent history. When the Japanese came after the last war they took the strongest men and the prettiest girls. Now the islanders live by themselves except for two Navy men. The islanders have made one of these men, Dr. Marshall Paul Wees of Saginaw, Mich., their No. 2 king.

LIFE's article may have glamorized the island of Fassarai, but it didn't tell the full story of Ulithi Atoll and the U.S. presence there. One significant clue in the article appeared in the caption of a photo showing a short strip of beach with open water beyond that read "Ulithi's calm lagoon, shown at sunset, is large enough to accommodate hundreds of U.S. ships."

Although it would still be several more months before the information would become public, this is exactly how Ulithi Atoll had been utilized since it was seized by U.S. forces in late September 1944. Following the exit of Japanese occupiers, the few remaining native Micronesians had voluntarily relocated to the island of Fassarai under U.S. Navy medical supervision.

Ulithi Atoll was just a speck on maps of the Pacific if it was even present. Officially part of the Caroline Islands, the atoll contained the world's fourth largest lagoon at 209 square miles. In addition to its size, Ulithi was perfectly located as a staging area for the United States against Japan. The Philippines, Formosa, and Okinawa--all of which were targets within U.S. sights--were similar distances from Ulithi.

By October 1944, Ulithi was the hub of U.S. Navy operations in the Western Pacific, a role it would maintain for eight months until the liberated Philippines replaced it as the new forward staging area. At the peak of its usage, during the initial buildup for Okinawa operations in March 1945, Ulithi Atoll was home to 617 American ships.

### 26 November 1944
USS *Astoria* CL-90 entered the lagoon at Ulithi anchorage and reported for duty.
From the Mighty Ninety cruise book:

> Ulithi, our base during the majority of our first cruise, is a small atoll in the Caroline Islands that is ignored on most of the world maps. Contrary to popular belief that it was a tropical paradise, as inspired by LIFEâ€™s glowing article, to us it was merely an anchorage and a rough one at that. We made liberty there, and on occasion to Mog Mog, one of the small islands that formed the atoll. There we could swim among the razor sharp coral and drink our three cans of beer. With no women and very little song it became just a spot of beer cans and coral where we could rest our feet from the steel decks of the ship.

The ships of the Fast Carrier Task Force also began to arrive, one group at a time, from their support of Leyte operations. In *Astoria's* newly-assigned unit, Task Group 38.2, three carriers had been hit by suicide planes off Leyte--*Hancock*, *Intrepid*, and *Cabot*. It was becoming clear that Mighty Ninety's role in screening the fast carriers would focus on threats from above.

The crew of Astoria spent the next few days resupplying in anticipation of a pending departure with her task group. The entire anchorage was a hive of activity preparing a quick turnaround: the fast carriers were returning to the Philippines to support landings on the island of Mindoro.

### 1 December 1944

Task Group 38.2 was *Astoria's* new assignment under the command of Rear Admiral Gerald Bogan. In the cruiser screen, the Mighty Ninety was joined by three other *Clevelands*: her Cramp-built sister *Miami* CL-89, *Vincennes* CL-64, and fellow newcomer *Pasadena* CL-65, a ship that *Astoria* would spend her entire career alongside. Rounding out the division was the older cruiser *San Juan* CL-54--a ship which had fought alongside *Astoria* CA-34 back at Guadalcanal in 1942.

When Task Groups 38.1 and 38.2 left Ulithi on 1 December, they were originally headed back to the Philippines for further combat operations, not training exercises. But a few hours after the ships put to sea, they learned that General MacArthur had postponed the Mindoro invasion by ten days. This news was well received, as it allowed the weary Task Group 38.3 to retire to Ulithi for rest and upkeep while the other groups conducted training exercises in the surrounding waters.

### 8 December 1944
*Astoria* and the ships of Task Group 38.2 returned to Ulithi for final provisioning and preparation. Three days later, USS *Astoria* CL-90 would steam for the Philippines as part of the greatest display of naval power that the world had ever seen: the Pacific Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force.
