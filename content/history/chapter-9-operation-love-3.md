### 8 December 1944

As *Astoria* returned to Ulithi upon the completion of training exercises, the Fast Carrier Task Force prepared to get underway for the next phase of the Philippine Liberation: the invasion of Mindoro, code-named Operation LOVE III. The island of Mindoro, just south of Luzon, was ideal for establishing airfields that could support the ultimate goal: landings on Luzon. While seaborne forces came ashore at Mindoro, aircraft from the fast carriers would play a suppression role over Japanese airfields across Luzon, preventing enemy air power from playing a role as it had at Leyte.

### 11 December 1944

From Halsey's Typhoon:
> At daybreak on December 11, Ulithi harbor was a whorl of activity. Gangs brought anchors to short stay and battle guidons whipped in the breeze as the ninety-odd ships of Task Force 38 steamed Indian-file at five-hundred yard intervals through Ulithi's Mugai [Channel], the only navigable passage into and out of the vast anchorage.

> On either side of this nautical parade, sailors cheered from the rails of the hundreds of Third Fleet auxiliaries remaining behind...  Overhead, land-based combat patrols formed a two-tiered umbrella guarding against stray bandits from Yap Island.  Yet despite the "sortie fever," it was a tranquil, almost idyllic morning...

From the Mighty Ninety cruise book:
> On the 11th of December we steamed out of Ulithi Atoll in company with Task Force 38 and started our first war job. We were all pretty excited because we didn’t know quite what to expect.

### 13 December 1944

After steaming northwest for two days, the fast carriers rendezvoused with the Logistic Support Group, Task Group 30.8, for their first underway replenishment of the operation. The oilers of TG30.8 had left Ulithi the day before the fast carriers and taken up position northeast of the Philippines. At the rendezvous point, the ships of Task Force 38 topped off with fuel oil in final preparation for their offensive operations in LOVE III.

Late in the afternoon, a flight of Japanese suicide planes attacked MacArthur's invasion forces as they approached Mindoro from the Sulu Sea. The light cruiser USS *Nashville* CL-43 was struck amidships by a bomb-laden Kamikaze with devastating results: 131 men killed, 192 wounded. Two hours later, a second plane slammed into the destroyer *Haraden* DD-585. The need for air cover from the fast carriers was apparent.

           attr="U.S. Navy photo in NARA record group 80-G-294526"

Overnight the task force began a fast run-in toward the coast of Luzon, where waves of carrier planes were launched before first light against installations and air bases across the island. Meanwhile the logistics support group maintained position east-northeast of Luzon in preparation for the return of a depleted Task Force 38 three days later.

### 14 December 1944

The Fast Carrier Task Force took up position less than 90 miles east of Luzon and launched aircraft to fly suppressive cover. The convoys of invasion craft would reach Mindoro to begin landings the next morning, and the fast carriers were determined to keep Japanese aircraft on the ground.

{{< figure src="/images/1944_12_14_vincennes.jpg"

           attr="U.S. Navy photo in NARA record group 80-G-431077"

For the next three days, this suppression strategy worked magnificently. From Morison's Liberation of the Philippines:
Since the primary task was to blanket the airfields, no large-scale destruction resulted from the raids of 14-16 December; none had been contemplated. Out of 1671 sorties flown, 1427 were fighter planes and only 244 were bombers. Only 336 tons of bombs were dropped altogether, as compared with the 300 tons per day which had formerly been typical of Task Force 38 strikes. Nevertheless, by these raids Admirals Halsey and McCain accomplished what they set out to do. With the exception of the one Japanese strike that took off before 14 December, no Luzon-based aircraft attacked our Mindoro-bound shipping...

Additionally, not a single Japanese plane penetrated the defensive air cover put in place surrounding the Fast Carrier Task Force. The only attempt came from a flight of eleven planes that were shot down by Combat Air Patrol from two of Astoria's carriers, Hancock and Lexington. Of 270 total enemy planes destroyed, 208 of them never left the ground. In return, American aircraft losses totaled 54, half of which came from aerial combat.

McCain's response to Kamikaze tactics had worked well.  So well, in fact, that *Astoria* had little more to do during Mindoro operations than maintain her position in formation, her crew watching while wave after wave of planes took off and landed from the carriers in her group.

### 16 December 1944

Following their third consecutive day of flight operations over Luzon, The Fast Carrier Task Force retired from the Philippines and steamed toward the next rendezvous with their oilers for refuel and resupply. Halsey's intent was to perform a quick underway replenishment and return to the Philippines, but the Pacific Ocean had other plans in store for USS ASTORIA and her task force.
