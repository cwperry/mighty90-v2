26 January 1945
USS *Astoria* and the Fast Carrier Task Force entered Ulithi Anchorage in the afternoon.

No time was lost in distributing overdue mail which the men eagerly hauled aboard. Movies were shown that evening. Beginning the next morning, groups of sailors were granted brief one-day liberty.  They packed aboard transports and headed across the anchorage for the Fleet Recreation Area at Mog Mog, an island on the northernmost end of the atoll.

Sailors on liberty at Mog Mog were only ashore for four hours. They were given ration chits redeemable for just two bottles or cans of warm beer (three by some accounts). A complex barter system developed, with men trading cash, smokes, and future liberty for others' ration chits. Inevitably some men found ways to get drunk as a result.

The enlisted men's areas were always crowded--15,000 men at a time crowded into the larger half of an island that was only 60 acres.  By comparison, Officers' Country provided a degree of luxury.  Officers drank at thatched-roof clubs where they purchased as much beer as they desired, and even sipped shots of hard liquor in relative comfort.

While the crew rotated through recreational liberty, the ship was a hive of activity.  Stores were taken aboard and preparations made for a Captain's Inspection scheduled to take place on 3 February.
