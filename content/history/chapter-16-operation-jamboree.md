### 10 February 1945:  OPERATION JAMBOREE

With their support of the Philippine Liberation concluded, the Fast Carrier Task Force headed north from Ulithi with an entirely new objective: strikes against Tokyo and mainland Japan.

These strikes were timed to coincide with preliminary bombardment of Iwo Jima several hundred miles to the south.  Ostensibly meant to serve as a distraction and limit Japanese air power over Iwo, the decision to direct the carriers against Tokyo also drew fierce criticism.  Resources were at a premium for aerial and shore bombardment in the lead-up to invasion.  The resulting compromise called for the carrier force to conduct limited strikes against Japan before retiring south to send ships and planes to bear in support of the Iwo Jima invasion.

The impact of these strikes to morale on both sides was intended to be profound.  The last time Tokyo had been bombed by a naval force was almost three years prior in the famed Doolittle Raid of April 1942. Instead of a handful of Army bombers, this time American carriers would bring a force of almost 1,000 planes.

With the arrival of fresh ships at Ulithi over the past two weeks, including more *Essex*-class carriers and air groups, Admiral Spruance reorganized his task groups.  USS *Astoria* and Cruiser Division 17 shifted from Group 2 to Group 3:

### 14 February 1945

With the addition of three fleet carriers (*Randolph* CV-15, *Bunker Hill* CV-17, and *Bennington* CV-20), Task Force 58 had sixteen total carriers spread across five task groups--four for daytime and one for night operations.  There was, however, an underlying cause for apprehension; almost half the air groups involved would be conducting their very first combat mission.

### 15 February 1945

From the Mighty Ninety Cruise Book:
> After we had been to sea several days we found we were going to raid Tokyo in support of the Iwo Jima landings that were to follow.  “This is it!” was the byword on the ship.  We felt that finally we would see some action.

From Morison's Victory in the Pacific:
> Everything possible was done to guard against detection.  Measures included radio deception, scouting by Pacific Fleet submarines to dispose of any picket vessels there might be en route, scouting by B-29s and Navy Liberators from the Marianas to clear the air.  On the 15th a scouting line of five destroyers ranged ahead of the carriers, and antisubmarine air patrol was set up.  At 1900 a high-speed run-in began toward launching positions, where the carriers arrived at dawn 16 February.  Thanks to these precautions, and to thick weather most of the way, they arrived undetected.

### 16 February 1945

Planes launched into heavy overcast from positions 60 miles off the coast of Honshu.  Weather was immediately a factor--heavy cloud, wind, rain and snow.  As a result, strikes on airfields surrounding Tokyo met with varying degrees of success throughout the day and Admiral Mitscher was forced to adjust his timetable to accommodate windows of opportunity in cloud cover.

Planes from Task Group 58.3 had the honor of being first over Tokyo due to a break in weather.  Overall there was very little Japanese opposition, and more planes were strafed on the ground than engaged in the air.

Combat was largely confined to airspace over the target areas. The Japanese did not bring much of a fight out to the carrier task force other than some isolated attacks over Task Group 58.1 that were repelled. For the men of the Mighty Ninety, the day was long, tedious, and very cold.

In the afternoon, three Japanese picket boats were spotted near Task Group 58.3. The destroyer USS *Haynesworth* DD-700 sunk the three boats, an event observed from *Astoria*.

The survivors were transferred aboard USS *Essex* and placed in the ship's brig. They became objects of considerable interest with the carrier's crew as the first Japanese they had ever encountered.
