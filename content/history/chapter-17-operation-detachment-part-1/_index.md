19 February 1945: D-Day
Once the order was given at 0630, the first waves of U.S. Marines began to pour onto the designated landing beaches of Iwo Jima.  Ten minutes later, at 0640, the U.S. Navy commenced their support bombardment.

Ships from Task Force 58 played a role from the start.  Two battleships and three cruisers had detached from the carrier force off Japan and now provided fire support alongside Task Force 54 for the landings throughout the day.

As the day progressed, it became clear that the actual ground gained would fall far short of D-Day expectations. The Japanese were too well dug in and resistance was fierce. Additional naval gunfire would be required for shore bombardment in the days that followed, and *Astoria* was called upon to assume this role.

As Task Group 58.3 refueled 75 miles west of Iwo Jima, Cruiser Division 17 was ordered to detach and move in toward the pitched battle. *Astoria*, *Pasadena*, and *Wilkes-Barre* joined Task Force 54 as temporary Task Unit 54.1.18 along with heavy cruisers *San Francisco* CA-38, *Boston* CA-69, and the four destroyers of DesDiv 106. Overnight they moved in toward the island.

Throughout the day gunfire erupted from Mighty Ninety's 6-inch main and 5-inch secondary batteries. For the 26 hours that followed, *Astoria* and her task unit rained shells onto targets across Iwo from the western side of the island.
