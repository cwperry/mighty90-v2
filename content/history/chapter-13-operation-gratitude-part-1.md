Following the surface actions of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, Admiral Halsey was champing at the bit for an opportunity to finish off ships of the Japanese Combined Fleet. Intelligence suggested that the remaining capital ships that had survived the actions at Leyte Gulf were divided into two sections--one group in the Inland Sea of Japan and the other in the South China Sea. Having missed the opportunity at Leyte, Halsey desperately wanted to engage the remaining Japanese surface threat and finish it off.

In January 1945, logistical requirements of the Luzon invasion made this desire a practical reality. The possibility of Japanese warships in the South China Sea posed a significant threat to the supply lines for Luzon. Airfields along the coast of French Indochina (modern Vietnam) and China were also within striking distance of these supply lines. The timing was ideal for a Task Force 38 incursion into Japanese-controlled waters, both to hunt for surface vessels and to strike other targets of opportunity.


9-10 January 1945
Overnight the ships of the Fast Carrier Task Force made a high-speed run southwest, entering the South China Sea via the Bashi Channel of Luzon Strait. This was the first time since the earliest days of the war that U.S. surface vessels had entered these waters.

At 0500 Air Emergency Stations were called--three Japanese "snoopers" had been picked up on radar. The night CAP fighters from USS *Independence* intercepted them to engage before they could report the presence of the task force.


11 January 1945
Poor weather conditions had prevented fueling the day before, but the morning of the 11th proved successful. Fueling and supply was complete by noon, and effective CAP ensured that the fleet was not discovered while at their most vulnerable. Mail and fuel oil weren't the only things circulating; scuttlebutt began to fly about what the next day might bring.

Confirmation came soon enough. The target area was Cam Ranh Bay, where capital ships of the Japanese Combined Fleet were believed to be anchored. USS *Astoria's* Task Group 38.2, fortified by cruisers and destroyers from TG38.1, was given the assignment of entering Cam Ranh Bay to bombard the area and destroy these surface vessels.

Following fueling, USS *Baltimore* and *Boston* plus five destroyers joined Task Group 38.2. At 1400 this fortified task group, including the night carriers, detached from the main force and began its run-in toward Cam Ranh Bay.

Admiral Halsey sent a message to his ships:
You know what to do--give them hell--God bless you all. HALSEY.

### 12 January 1945

At 0300 the night carriers took the lead in the attack on Cam Ranh Bay. Eight two-plane search teams of TBM Avenger bombers launched from *Enterprise* and *Independence*.

From Edward Stafford's The Big E:
> The blacked-out TBMs fanned out over the [Indochina] coast from a hundred miles to seaward like the fingers of an exploring hand, peering through the night with radar, laying naked suspicious areas with the harsh brilliance of parachute flares, occasionally scorching a rocket or two into likely targets. And behind the probing fingers, the heavy fist of the day carriers was cocked and ready.

At 0731, as the surface strike unit approached Cam Ranh, aircraft were launched from carriers across all task groups. The Avengers launched from the night carriers had provided precise information on locations of Japanese targets, and strikes were dispatched accordingly.

No heavy ships had been sighted. The Japanese Combined Fleet was not in Cam Ranh Bay, nor anywhere else that had been scouted. Frustrated, Halsey ordered the surface strike unit to turn back and the task groups were reconstituted. The focus for the day turned to making the most of the aerial raids taking place against smaller Japanese surface vessels, merchant shipping, and port facilities.

Samuel Eliot Morison later wrote:
> Task Force 38 planes sank 44 ships totaling about 132,700 tons. Of these, 15 ships... were combatant vessels of the Japanese Navy and 29 ships... belonged to the merchant marine. An even dozen of the sunk Marus were oil tankers. Admiral Halsey did not exaggerate in calling this "one of the heaviest blows to Japanese shipping of any day of the war," and stating that "Japanese supply routes from Singapore, Malaya, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies were severed, at least temporarily."

At 1931, exactly twelve hours after airstrikes were launched, Task Force 38 steamed away from Indochina for a refueling rendezvous with the Logistic Support Group. The U.S. Navy later discovered the true location of the elusive Japanese capital ships. They had been moved much further south to safe anchorage at Lingga Roads, Malaya.

### 13 January 1945

Weather conditions again deteriorated as the task force steamed on a northeasterly course. The high-speed departure from the Indochina coast had served two purposes--to prevent an enemy search and to outrun an approaching typhoon. As the seas rose throughout the morning, fueling proved to be impossible. Many ships parted lines while attempting to pass across fueling hoses.

*Astoria* had developed a reputation for sound execution in refueling operations. Admiral Halsey singled her out to make an attempt and demonstrate conclusively whether fueling was possible or not.

When *Astoria* failed to fuel, Halsey decided to postpone fueling operations until the next day.

For the crew of USS *Astoria*, what happened next was the most memorable event from the South China Sea incursion. The ship's forward 20mm battery was not secured, and it began sluing wildly as the ship pitched and rolled. Captain Gerard T. Armitage led several of his men forward to secure the guns.

The two 20mm mounts were situated far forward on the ship's bow. Armitage and his men made their way across the forecastle in treacherous conditions--whipping wind and lashing seas on a slippery deck. They reached the forward battery and managed to secure one of the loose guns. But as they turned their attention to the other gun, the ship dipped into a trough in the high seas. The bow plunged below the surface and the Marines were caught between exposed metal and crashing water.

Two men were battered by the loose 20mm mount. Captain Armitage was lifted off the deck by the surging water and swept clear of the ship. When *Astoria's* bow resurfaced, the Marine Captain was gone.

           caption="The bow of USS *Wilkes-Barre* CL-103 plunges below the surface on 13 January 1945. A similar plunge by twin sister *Astoria* took Marine Captain Gerard T. Armitage overboard."

The formation was moving at a steady clip through heavy seas; turning to retrieve their lost officer was not a possibility for *Astoria*. The report of "man overboard" was signaled back.

Armitage was wearing a kapok life jacket. The Marine Captain crested mountainous waves and disappeared in troughs, falling further and further behind his ship as the formation passed. The responsibility for a rescue attempt eventually fell upon one of the formation's destroyers, USS *Halsey Powell* DD-686.

*Halsey Powell* was on the perimeter of the task force, miles behind *Astoria*. When she maneuvered to attempt the rescue, she was the only ship able to do so. Her crew fought the same treacherous seas that had swept Armitage from his ship. They eventually managed to get a line to him and reel him in, pulling Armitage aboard and ending a very harrowing experience for the soaked Marine officer in the South China Sea.

### 14 January 1945

Despite more poor weather, the task group managed to refuel the destroyers and bring larger ships to at least 60% capacity. This was enough to continue operations.

>}}

As the task force refueled, *Halsey Powell* came up alongside *Astoria*. The destroyer demanded the standard U.S. Navy ransom for recovery of an overboard man; Captain Armitage would be returned to his ship in exchange for twenty-five gallons of ice cream from *Astoria's* galley.

### 15 January 1945

Halsey was given the green light to conduct further strikes in the direction of Hong Kong. Along the way he intended to continue the search for capital ships of the Japanese Combined Fleet. Weather remained terrible as the Fast Carrier Task Force steamed north. In spite of adverse conditions, the task force launched planes.

### 16 January 1945

Air strikes launched in the early morning. The focus for the day's attacks was Hong Kong with ancillary raids conducted against Hainan and Canton. Weather was again a factor, and unexpectedly heavy antiaircraft fire also took its toll.

{{< figure src="/images/1945_01_16_hong_kong_harbor_1.jpg"

           attr="U.S. Navy photo in Brent Jones collection"
>}}

Overall the results of the day's raids were disappointing. One freighter and one tanker were confirmed sunk with four more ships heavily damaged. Only 13 enemy planes were destroyed, while the fast carriers lost 49 total, many of which fell victim to heavy antiaircraft fire.

Once again, the Japanese Combined Fleet was nowhere to be found. Following the day's raids, Radio Tokyo announced the presence of the Fast Carrier Task Force in the South China Sea. Tokyo Rose reportedly stated, "we don't know how you got in, but how the hell are you going to get out?"
