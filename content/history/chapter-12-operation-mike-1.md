### 30 December 1944

Following hasty repair, the Fast Carrier Task Force sortied again from Ulithi to support the next operation of the Philippine Liberation:  the invasion of Luzon, code-named Operation MIKE I.  Luzon and its capital of Manila were the prize; all operations to this point were incremental steps toward their liberation.

S-Day (as Luzon D-Day was called) was set for 9 January at Lingayen Gulf.  U.S. invasion forces of the 7th Fleet would sortie from Leyte Gulf, cross the Philippines into the Sulu Sea, and head north past liberated Mindoro en route to the west coast of Luzon.  Once again the fast carriers would be tasked with suppression of Japanese air power that could oppose the American landing forces.  Their targets would be airfields ranging from Formosa (modern Taiwan) and surrounding islands to northern Luzon.

### 3 January 1945  (S-Day minus 6)
Halsey's plans called for Task Force 38 to first focus their strikes against Japanese airfields on and around Formosa before heading south to hit airfields on northern Luzon.  The blanketing tactics that had been so successful during Mindoro operations were to be employed again.  Even more fighters had been added to the fast carriers' arsenal, and *Essex* CV-9 became the first carrier to incorporate squadrons of USMC Corsairs along with her Navy planes.

From the launch of first strikes on the morning of 3 January, Halsey's forces encountered foul weather that would become a persistent presence over the next three weeks.  Heavy overcast was both a blessing and a curse.  Although blanketing tactics weren't possible, the Japanese did not send up many planes against the task force.  Over the next two days missions against some targets were carried out, but many were recalled or scrubbed.  Accurate results were not recorded, but best guesses placed Japanese losses at 100 planes versus 22 American planes lost.

Meanwhile, the invasion force making its long run up the western side of the Philippines suffered increasing Japanese attacks including suicide crashes on several ships.  Most notably, the escort carrier *Ommaney Bay* CVE-79 was struck on 4 January by a Japanese plane and two bombs that it released prior to impact.  As fires burned out of control and ammunition exploded, *Ommaney Bay* was abandoned and scuttled.

Although Navy planes from the escort carriers and Army Air Force planes from Mindoro worked together to keep this threat to a minimum, the fast carriers would be sorely needed at Luzon.

### 5 January 1945  (S minus 4)

The task force withdrew out of range from land-based aircraft and fueled from the Logistic Support Group.  USS *Enterprise* joined up underway, fresh from Pearl Harbor where modifications had been completed enabling her to conduct night operations.  *Enterprise*, now designated CV(N)-6, and *Independence* CVL-22 were intended to extend the \"Big Blue Blanket\" over Luzon airfields in a nighttime capacity.  Forming the new Task Group 38.5, the night carriers joined the protective screen of *Astoria* and Task Group 38.2 during the day.

### 6 January 1945  (S minus 3)

Heavy weather again limited the strikes conducted by the fast carriers as well as enemy planes.  32 more Japanese aircraft were estimated shot down or destroyed on the ground.  However, breaks in the weather and subsequent holes in blanketing tactics permitted some Japanese planes to get airborne and attack the invasion force.  Although Combat Air Patrols (CAP) prevented any planes from getting through to the fast carriers, several ships in the invasion force approaching Lingayen Gulf were hit.

### 7 January 1945  (S minus 2)
The weather cleared during the morning hours for the second day of fast carrier strikes against northern Luzon, then deteriorated again in the afternoon.

From Morison's The Liberation of the Philippines:
> The enemy seemed unwilling to challenge the carrier planes; he was saving his planes for what he considered a more worthy object.  Throughout the entire day of the 7th only four Japanese aircraft were observed to rise in order to give battle, and they were promptly shot down.  Task Force 38 claimed to have destroyed 75 others on the ground; its own losses were heavy--28 planes, 18 of these operational [losses].  With the assistance of 143 sorties from the eleven escort carriers with [7th Fleet], and of the Army Air Force, these strikes accomplished their object of protecting the fleet at Lingayen Gulf, for a time, from Kamikaze attack...  and the Japanese air forces on Luzon were almost wiped out.

### 8 January 1945  (S minus 1)

The Fast Carrier Task Force left the Philippines and headed north again.  They spent the day refueling and resupplying with the Logistic Support Group, then performed a run-in toward Formosa overnight for a second round of strikes on the northern island airfields within range of the S-Day landing area.  With Japanese air forces on Luzon essentially neutralized, planes from the Formosa area were the remaining threat.

### 9 January 1945  (S-Day, OPERATION MIKE I)

As MacArthur's 6th Army came ashore at Lingayen Gulf, bad weather once again restricted the fast carrier planes to targets of opportunity.  Some missions were recalled while others found breaks in the weather and pushed on to their targets.  717 sorties were flown against airfields and Japanese shipping.  The operations achieved their goal--no Japanese planes from Formosa airfields were able to provide resistance against the invasion, and in fact no further Japanese planes would fly to Luzon for the remainder of the war.

For the men of USS *Astoria*, the ship's involvement in the MIKE I operation had been fairly routine.  While enduring the daily nuisance of heavy rain, there was little for the Mighty Ninety to do other than screen her assigned carriers,stand watch and wait.  F Division shipmate Jim Thomson expressed the crew's desire to get into the fight, writing in his diary that "we have yet to fire an offensive gun!"  J. Fred Lind added,  "lots of mines are floating harmlessly by. The destroyers are assigned to blow them up with their five-inch battery."

From Samuel Eliot Morison's The Liberation of the Philippines:
>Third Fleet's direct support of the Lingayen operation ended with these 9 January strikes on Formosa.  In one week, Task Force 38 had flown a total of 3,030 target or combat sorties and dropped 9,110 bombs... losing 86 planes, 40 of them operationally.  There is no question but that these operations, combined with the all-out effort of the Army Air Force and the escort carriers, saved hundreds of American lives in the Lingayen landings.

Although their support of Operation MIKE I was effectively over, the Fast Carrier Task Force was far from finished in conducting offensive operations in the area.  Halsey's ships would next take the fight into the so-called "Private Lake of Japan," the South China Sea.
