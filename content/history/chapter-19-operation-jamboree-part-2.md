Following the surface actions of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, Admiral Halsey was champing at the bit for an opportunity to finish off ships of the Japanese Combined Fleet. Intelligence suggested that the remaining capital ships that had survived the actions at Leyte Gulf were divided into two sections--one group in the Inland Sea of Japan and the other in the South China Sea. Having missed the opportunity at Leyte, Halsey desperately wanted to engage the remaining Japanese surface threat and finish it off.

An intriguing side note is that Miami's aviation unit was responsible for the overhead view of USS *Randolph* the day after her Kamikaze hit in her berth on 11 March, making it entirely possible that these photos show that flight in progress. *Randolph's* berth would be in the center distance of this photograph and all ships identified were present as of the morning of 12 March, so it all matches well."
