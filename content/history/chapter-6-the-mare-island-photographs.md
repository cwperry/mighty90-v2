### 21 October 1944

In the morning hours USS *Astoria* CL-90 made preparations to get underway for trials on a second replacement turbine bearing. While the ship prepared to depart Mare Island, a sequence of nine recognition photographs were taken.

If USS Astoria had not experienced either of the two failures of bearings in her turbines, she would have joined the fast carriers weeks earlier and been present for combat operations in Leyte Gulf. Instead, she spent this period enduring repairs stateside.
