After 26 hours of continuous fire support, Task Unit 54.1.18 was dissolved and Cruiser Division 17 retired from Iwo Jima for rest. The success of their bombardment is recounted in *Astoria's* cruise book:

> For two days and one night we sent 6” and 5” shells into our assigned targets where they would do the most good. Our fire was accurate and when we shoved off we had accounted for several pillboxes, gun emplacements and had broken up a [Japanese] counter-attack. It was in this engagement that we destroyed our first plane. The main battery demolished it with a stray shell while firing on a [Japanese] emplacement.

In her first action, *Astoria* had fired 3000 rounds during shore bombardment for advancing U.S. Marines and Navy personnel at Iwo Jima. Although the ships of Cruiser Division 17 pulled away from Iwo Jima unscathed, VCS-17 suffered a combat loss: One of *Wilkes-Barre's* OS2N-1 Kingfishers performed a forced landing due to engine failure and was a total loss.

### 23 February 1945  D+4

While the reconstituted Fast Carrier Task Force steamed toward Japan for a second round of air raids on Tokyo, their efforts at Iwo were paying off. Hours after *Astoria* and her task unit left Iwo Jima, elements of the 5th Marine Division reached the top of Mt. Suribachi. Two successive flags were raised through the course of the day and the most famous photograph of the war was taken.

While the Rosenthal photo came to symbolize victory at Iwo Jima for the American public, in reality the fighting continued for several more weeks. Although Suribachi had fallen, many more would lose their lives before the island was secured.
