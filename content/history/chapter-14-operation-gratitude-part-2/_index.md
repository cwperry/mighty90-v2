### 17-19 January 1945

Getting out of the South China Sea was indeed becoming a significant problem. The weather remained heavy, seas were rough, and fueling was difficult. The task force held station west of Luzon in hopes that the weather would improve. Supplies began to dwindle.

The next day offered no improvement. From Morison's The Liberation of the Philippines:
18 January proved even worse than the 17th. Fueling was impossible, and by noon Task Force 38 again had to reverse course and sail south in search of protected waters. Since fleet aerologists predicted that foul weather would continue at least through 19 January, Halsey decided that he had better fuel under the lee of Luzon that day and then leave South China Sea by Surigao Strait.

Halsey's new route out would take the fleet far to the south.  Admiral Nimitz pushed back and strongly encouraged Halsey to find a way to exit the South China Sea via the northern route.  Nimitz wished to minimize risk and protect the carriers from the vulnerability of straying too far from their planned area of operations.  He also meant to keep them in position to strike Formosa and Okinawa.

Halsey complied with his orders, and was able to eventually fuel and supply his ships by finding a break in the weather.  The task force once again headed north.

### 20 January 1945

From Morison's The Liberation of the Philippines:
> By the afternoon... Task Force 38 was heading east into Balingtang Channel, a destroyer division sweeping ahead of the three task groups.  Bogeys were almost constantly on the screen, but no attack developed; and about 15 enemy planes which were evacuating air personnel from Luzon to Formosa were shot down.

### 21 January 1945

In the early morning hours, the fast carriers took position to conduct more strikes against shipping and airfields across Formosa and the surrounding smaller islands. The Japanese airfields had been repaired and more planes shuttled in from the mainland while Halsey's ships were hunting further south over the past ten days. As the American planes launched throughout the morning, it became apparent that the weather would finally cooperate.

Planes of the Japanese Special Attack Corps based at Tainan, Formosa were taking advantage of the clear skies. As *Astoria* shipmates watched the flak bursts from a distance, Task Group 38.3 caught the worst of the attacks. At noon the light carrier USS LANGLEY was struck by two small Japanese bombs, damaging her flight deck and temporarily disrupting recovery operations. Minutes later, a suicide plane dove from out of the sun on the fleet carrier USS *Ticonderoga* and crashed into her flight deck. The plane's 550-lb. bomb penetrated and detonated between the hangar and gallery decks. Intense fires broke out on *Ticonderoga*'s hangar deck among tightly packed, fueled planes.

While Task Group 38.3 fought their battle, a group of 13 enemy planes launched from Luzon approached Task Group 38.1. CAP planes from USS *Cowpens* intercepted them and disrupted the attack. USS *Astoria*'s task group wasn't touched, insulated against attacks from Formosa in the north and Luzon in the south by the other groups.

At 1250, 13 more enemy planes from Formosa descended upon Task Group 38.3. The heavily smoking *Ticonderoga* provided a clear target. Although CAP and antiaircraft screen destroyed 12 of the would-be attackers, the 13th made it through and crashed into the carrier's island superstructure at her forward fire director.

The carnage for the task force continued, as twenty minutes later the destroyer picket USS *Maddox* DD-731 was hit. She fell victim to a "Tail-end Charlie," a Japanese Zero that joined an American formation of planes returning from air strikes.

At 1328 Task Group 38.2 suffered their first casualty of the day, albeit from a different source. USS *Hancock* was recovering strike aircraft when a TBM Avenger landed with a live bomb that had failed to release from its ordnance bay. The bomb detonated on the carrier deck, immediately killing the Avenger's crew and many surrounding flight deck personnel. The explosion burst through to the gallery and hangar decks causing multiple fires.

By mid-afternoon, fires has been brought under control aboard the wounded carriers. Among the casualties was the skipper of *Ticonderoga*, Captain Dixie Kiefer, badly wounded in the second attack. He was evacuated to a hospital ship.

The Japanese attacks subsided, and by late afternoon damage control and emergency repairs had been completed. That evening *Ticonderoga* and *Maddox* were detached to limp back to Ulithi accompanied by two light cruisers and three destroyers.

One additional event took place on 21 January which held personal significance to the men aboard the Mighty Ninety. In the early afternoon, Kingfisher floatplanes of VCS-17 (Scout Squadron, Cruiser Division 17) were dispatched from *Astoria* and *Pasadena* to rescue downed airmen in the sea west of Formosa. Senior Aviator LT Charles Tanner piloted the single plane launched from *Astoria* with instructions to meet up with two planes from *Pasadena* and head to the site of the downed aircrew. But as the day progressed and night fell, the three planes did not return to their ships.

The day was both productive and costly. 1164 sorties were flown from the fast carriers, resulting in 104 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground, more than 30 in the air, and ten Japanese merchant ships sunk. But the Japanese Special Attack Corps had managed to place a hefty price tag on these successes. A fleet carrier had been knocked out of action and 205 men were listed killed or missing in action aboard the four damaged ships. An additional 351 men were wounded.

### 22 January 1945

Overnight Task Force 38 steamed northeast and took up position off Okinawa. Strikes for the day targeted shipping and airfields, but the primary objective of the day's operations was to perform photographic reconnaissance in preparation for the Okinawa invasion scheduled for April.

Reports were pieced together regarding the previous day's rescue mission. Word began to circulate throughout the ship regarding Senior Aviator Tanner.

As it turned out, the downed aircrew had been picked up by an American submarine on "lifeguard duty" before the VCS-17 Kingfishers could arrive. Tanner and the *Pasadena* pilots searched in vain for the aircrew and finally turned around. During their return trip, the *Pasadena* planes ran low on fuel and were forced to land on the ocean. LT Tanner made the decision to land his plane to stay with one of the *Pasadena* planes on the surface overnight. He had not been heard from since.

### 23-25 January 1945

Offensive operations for MIKE I and GRATITUDE completed, Task Force 38 began the long haul back to Ulithi. Although USS *Astoria* was now a combat veteran with two Battle Stars under her belt, she had yet to fire an offensive shot. Her surface fire mission against the Imperial Japanese Navy had been thwarted by the absence of ships at Cam Ranh Bay, and so far her participation in aerial attacks over the fast carriers had been limited to watching from a distance. Her excellent gunnery in practice had yet to be tested in combat.

With the return to Ulithi, Admiral Halsey and his staff handed the reigns of the Fast Carrier Task Force over to Admiral Spruance. 3rd Fleet officially became 5th Fleet, and Task Force 38 became Task Force 58, designations intended to confuse the enemy in thinking they belonged to separate fleets.

In his parting message to his Sailors and Marines, Admiral Halsey stated:
> I am so proud of you that no words can express my feelings. This has been a hard operation. At times you have been driven almost beyond endurance but only because the stakes were high, the enemy was as weary as you were, and the lives of many Americans could be spared in later offensives if we did our work well now. We have driven the enemy off the sea and back to his inner defenses. Superlatively well done.
-Halsey.
