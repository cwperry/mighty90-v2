### 25-31 October 1944

For six days USS *Astoria*, *Montpelier*, and *Baltimore* steamed toward Pearl Harbor. Their experience over this period was recorded in the diary of S1/c James J. Fahey, USS *Montpelier*:

> The weather was very cold and the sea was very rough until we were about one day from Pearl Harbor. Quite a few men got seasick, I did not. We ate our meals on the deck because the sea was too rough to set the benches and tables; they would have crashed into the bulkheads. We had to wear plenty of clothing on watch to keep warm.

> The other ships with us would almost go out of sight in the heavy big seas because the waters were so rough. The light cruiser *Astoria* and the heavy cruiser *Baltimore* also had left with us.

From the diary of S1/c James J. Fahey:

> We fired all guns on the way to Pearl Harbor. Also, the same day we pulled into Pearl Harbor, B-26 bombers towed sleeves for us to shoot at... When we pulled into Pearl Harbor we tied up to a buoy. The weather was warm and it felt good to go around in your shirtsleeves. Our mail went off the ship and movies were held topside the first night we got there.

### 31 October 1944
Upon arrival at Pearl Harbor, USS *Astoria* reported for duty with Commander Cruisers Pacific (ComCruPac). She remained in Hawaiian waters to conduct further gunnery drills.

> Tuesday, November 7, 1944: The war news for the last week of October said that our Navy knocked the Jap Navy out and our troops landed in the Central Philippines on Leyte... They called it the greatest sea battle in history, the Japs lost 64 warships. We will be out there soon. Today is election day, I think Roosevelt will get elected again. Everyone here thinks he will get in by a big margin.

### 10 November 1944

> On the way out [of Pearl Harbor], a light cruiser and two destroyers came in. They were all banged up from the sea battle Oct 23, 1944 [sic], it will take some time to repair them... the bridge on one of the ships was blown off. They must have had a lot of casualties.

This incident had taken place while *Astoria* was still at Mare Island. But when *Birmingham() limped into Pearl Harbor on 10 November, the men of the Mighty Ninety had a close-up view of what could become the fate of a *Cleveland*-class cruiser in the Pacific War.

### 17 November 1944

*Astoria* departed Hawaii to rendezvous with the Fast Carrier Task Force forward deployed in the Western Pacific. En route she crossed the 180th meridian, the International Date Line. Crossing this line headed west meant losing a 24-hour period in time, an event with special significance for sailors. The service records for men aboard ship at this time list a cryptic entry: \"Crossed the 180th meridian headed west with permission of the Golden Dragon.\"

### 23 November 1944

*Astoria* put into Eniwetok Atoll, a fueling station and anchorage for the U.S. Navy. After fueling from an oiler, the crew of the Mighty Ninety had a fine Thanksgiving dinner aboard ship.

*Astoria* spent fewer than five hours in the anchorage, just enough time for fueling and a mid-afternoon turkey dinner. She headed west with a further 1,400 nautical miles in front of her. Accompanying *Astoria* for anti-submarine screen was the destroyer USS *Kalk* DD-611.

### 25 November 1944

While Astoria made the last leg of her journey across the Pacific, the carnage continued for the Fast Carrier Task Force in the final stages of Leyte operations. On 25 November, Japanese suicide planes struck the Fast Carrier Task Force with a fury.

Damage to *Intrepid*'s flight deck and arresting gear made recovery impossible for the 75 planes she had airborne; they were forced to land on other carriers. *Intrepid* suffered heavy casualties this day--69 dead and missing, 35 wounded." 
           attr="U.S. Navy photo in NARA collection"
>}}

Four carriers were damaged to various degrees: *Hancock* CV-19, *Cabot* CVL-28, *Intrepid* CV-11, and *Essex* CV-9. As a result, the strikes planned for the next day were called off and the fast carriers retired for Ulithi, ending their support of Leyte.

From Retaking the Philippines:
American brass in the Philippines came to grips with the fact that they were being confronted by a revolutionary method of warfare, one that presented a serious threat to the future conduct of the war: swarms of Kamikazes were wreaking havoc with American vessels in Philippine waters. No longer could the suicide attacks be shrugged off as isolated acts of desperation.

So serious was the menace that General MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz had ordered a news blackout to prevent the Japanese high command from learning of the enormous damage and casualties its suicide pilots were inflicting, and to keep the American home front from panicking.

Admiral William Halsey wrote that "further casual strikes did not appear profitable; only strikes in great force for valuable stakes or at vital times would justify exposure of the fast carriers to suicidal attacks--at least until better defensive techniques were perfected. The Japanese Special Attack Corps was forcing the U.S. Navy to change their tactics. At Leyte, one carrier had been lost and five others left the area requiring extensive repairs.

Such was the state of war in the Pacific Theater. The next time the fast carriers sortied against Imperial Japan, *Astoria* would be charged with protecting them.
