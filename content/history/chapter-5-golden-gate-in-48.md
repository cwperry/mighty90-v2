### 24 July 1944

USS Astoria's number two turbine was ruined. The bearing problem had not been identified quickly enough to prevent extensive damage. As a result, the ship spent a lengthy post-shakedown overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard while the turbine was cut out of the hull and repaired.

### 10 September 1944

After seven full weeks moored to the starboard side of Pier Two at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, *USS Astoria* got underway in the Delaware River for trials on her new turbine. Much like her very first run down the river, she proceeded to Brandywine Shoal and headed back. Her tests on the new engine were successful.

### 14 September 1944

*Astoria* docked at the Fort Mifflin Naval Ammunition Storage Depot across the Schuykill River from Philadelphia Navy Yard. As the crew loaded the ship's magazines with shells and powder, they did so in gale-force winds. A strong hurricane was making its way up the East Coast and passed very close by on this date. The storm, later known as the 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane, made landfall on the New Jersey shore with devastating results.

### 3 October 1944

While conducting drills off San Diego in the morning hours, the after bearing on Astoria's number four turbine failed. The crew reacted well to this repeat of her shakedown cruise casualty, and the turbine was shut down before major damage could occur. Once again down an engine, Astoria put in at San Diego so Captain Dyer could discuss his next move for a ship with an obvious construction defect.

### 5 October 1944

The decision was made to send Astoria up to the San Francisco bay area for repair and evaluation at Mare Island Navy Yard. Engineering representatives from the Navy as well as General Electric, manufacturer of the turbine engine, would meet the ship at Mare Island for the repair work.
